### Overview

A __Library Management System__ is software specifically made to manage every part of a library. It helps librarians in maintaining a database of newly released books and also books that members have borrowed as well as their due dates. It is also used to maintain library records. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library, how many books are issued, how many books have been returned or renewed or late fine charges, etc.

### Tools

This project was made using __Java__ as the main programming language, __CSS__ to establish the design, and __JavaFX__ as the platform to create a desktop application.
